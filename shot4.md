# What are microservices?

  - The Modular and the loosely coupled entity interms involved in accomplishment of the task in the process of the Software Engineering.


# Advantages
  - Modular
  - Parallel Development scope is being provided 
  - Single Mode of the task performance
  - Loosely Coupled

# Disadavantages
  - Because of the Latency there would be a problem.
  - Rise in infrastructure in high scale systems just by keeping on increasing the services
  - Service Management and the Deployment being done individually.
  - Creates a Nano Service Anti pattern strategy.


# Why do many microservice project fails?
  - Lack of skills
  - Lack of Planning
  - Lack of time
  - Lack of Knowledge
# How to prevent the projects from failing?
  - Determining the Applicability
  - Proritizing the Automation
  - Have a clear plan
  - Avoid the pitfalls.
So, we will be going throught the set of the tools that are rquired to design the micro service based system effectively .
